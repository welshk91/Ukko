<p align="center">A weather app that fetches Tampa's current weather.

## Description
This app started as a basic coding assessment for a client. Barebones functionality, but organized & clean. Perhaps I'll add more to this later.

Written in Kotlin, this app uses the standard pillars of Android development: [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) for networking, [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) for Dependency Injection, [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata), [ViewModels](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel), and [Databinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding) in an [MVVM](https://www.journaldev.com/20292/android-mvvm-design-pattern) pattern.
